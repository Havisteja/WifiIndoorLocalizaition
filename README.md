# Enhancing the wifi indoor localisation using machine learning algorithm
## Getting started
Here, we used eight machine learning algorithms to enhance the performance. We used ANN, KNN, Decision tree, Naive Bayesian, ELM, SVM for this project. Additional we use Logistic Regression, Random Forest algorithms to analyze the performance enhancement. 

### Dataset
wifi_localization.csv file is the dataset for this project.
We used dataset from the UCI machine learnign library. In the dataset there are signal strength from seven routers and measured from the fur grids. 

### How it works
We trained the machine learning algorithms with the dataset. If we give the signal strength of the seven routers then the algorithms will predict in which grid the user is.

### Applications
We can use wifi based indoor localization in the places like airport, healthcare system, shopping mall etc. as wifi is now a days common thing for all the plcae outside and inside and almost all the people are using smart phone for their day to day life.
